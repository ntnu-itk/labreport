\section{Awesome section name}
Here you can write all your sweet findings from the lab. However this document is meant as a short template to get started using \LaTeX{} for lab assignments. If you have done this before, you might pick up a few useful hints. Most of the fun happens in the tex files, so have a look there. This document does not contain any guidelines on what the report should contain, and how the it should be structured. Refer to ItsLearning for that.

This section is really short, since it is an introduction.
