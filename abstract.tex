This document outlines a few important aspects of a lab report. It contains some advice on both content and layout. The \LaTeX{} source for this document is also published, and you can use it as a template of sorts for your own report. The main file, ``labreport.tex'', defines the structure of the document and includes a lot of comments.

When you write your own report, this section (the abstract) should contain a \emph{very} short summary of what the lab is about and what you have done.
